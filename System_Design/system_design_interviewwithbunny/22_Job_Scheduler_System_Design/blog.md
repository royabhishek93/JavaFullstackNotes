Distributed Job Scheduler (Airflow/Temporal)

"DAG-based scheduling → Redis/DB for job queue → Multiple executors → Kafka for retry/dead-letter → Watcher for monitoring"

1. Functional Requirements

Feature 1: Ability to schedule a job at specified times (immediate/future/cron expression)
Feature 2: Monitor the status of jobs in real-time (pending, running, success, failed, cancelled)
Feature 3: Support update/cancel scheduled jobs before execution
Feature 4: Support job dependencies - DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution order
Feature 5: Retry mechanism with configurable retry count and backoff strategy
Feature 6: Dead letter queue for permanently failed jobs
Feature 7: Job prioritization and resource allocation (CPU, memory limits per job)
2. Non-Functional Requirements

Scale & Performance
Job Volume — Millions of jobs per day, thousands of jobs per second
Executors — 100s of executor instances for parallel job execution
Latency — Jobs should execute within 2s of scheduled time (±2s tolerance)
Reliability & Consistency
CAP Theorem — Availability >> Consistency (Job should run at least once, eventual consistency acceptable)
Execution Guarantee — At-least-once execution (jobs may retry on failure, idempotency required)
Durability — Job state persisted, no jobs lost even on system failure
Scheduling Requirements
Cron Support — Standard cron expressions (0 0 * * * for daily at midnight)
Time Zones — Support scheduling in different time zones
Backfill — Ability to run missed jobs (if scheduler was down)
3. Core Entities

Entity 1: Job - Task definition with job_id, name, schedule (cron/timestamp), payload, dependencies
Entity 2: Scheduler - Component that schedules jobs based on time/cron expressions
Entity 3: Executor - Worker that executes jobs, pulls from queue and runs job logic
Entity 4: JobRun - Execution instance with run_id, job_id, status, start_time, end_time, logs
Entity 5: DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) - Workflow with multiple dependent jobs
4. API Designing

Job Management
POST /v1/api/jobs — Create/schedule a job {name, schedule: 'cron/timestamp', payload, retry: 3, dependencies: []}
GET /v1/api/jobs/{jobId} — Get job details (schedule, status, last run time)
GET /v1/api/jobs/{jobId}/status — Get current status of job execution
PUT /v1/api/jobs/{jobId} — Update job schedule or payload
POST /v1/api/jobs/{jobId}/cancel — Cancel a scheduled/running job
POST /v1/api/jobs/{jobId}/runnow — Run job immediately (trigger ad-hoc execution)
Monitoring
GET /v1/api/jobs/runs — List all job runs with filters (status, date range)
GET /v1/api/jobs/{jobId}/runs — Get execution history for specific job
GET /v1/api/jobs/stats — Get statistics (total jobs, success rate, avg execution time)
5. High Level Design

Clients/Users → LB + API Gateway: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, routing
Job Service → Job DB (PostgreSQL): Stores job definitions (schedule, payload, dependencies, retry config)
Job Executor → Job DB: Pulls jobs that need to be executed, updates status
Scheduler (Watcher) → Redis + Kafka: Polls jobs scheduled for execution, publishes to Kafka topics
Kafka Topics: run (immediate execution), retry (failed jobs with retry), dead (permanently failed)
Job Consumer Service → Executor Pool: Consumes from Kafka, dispatches to available executors
Executor Services (100s instances): Execute job logic, update status in DB, publish results to Kafka
Redis: Stores last-polled-time for scheduler, distributed locks for executors
6. Deep Dive Design (Low Level)

Step 1: Job Creation & Scheduling
User sends: POST /v1/api/jobs with {name: 'ETL Pipeline', schedule_type: 'cron', schedule_value: '0 0 * * *', payload: {db_connection}, retry_count: 3, timeout: 3600}
Job Service validates: Cron expression valid, schedule_time in future if one-time, dependencies don't create cycles (DAG validation)
Service creates: Job record in PostgreSQL {job_id: UUID, name, schedule_type: 'cron', schedule_value, status: 'scheduled', next_run_time: '2025-01-21T00:00:00Z', created_at}
Service calculates: next_run_time using cron parser library (croniter in Python), stores in indexed column for efficient polling
Service returns: {job_id, status: 'scheduled', next_run_time}
Step 2: Scheduler (Watcher) Polling
Watcher service runs: Infinite loop with 20-second interval (configurable)
Service queries: SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status IN ('scheduled', 'running') AND next_run_time <= NOW() AND last_polled_time < (NOW - 30s) LIMIT 1000
Service fetches: 1000 jobs ready for execution, updates last_polled_time = NOW() to prevent duplicate processing by other watchers
For each job: Calculate if should run based on schedule_type - for cron, check if current time matches expression, for one-time check if next_run_time passed
Service publishes: Job to Kafka topic 'run' with {job_id, run_id: UUID, payload, timestamp, attempt: 1}
Step 3: Job Consumption & Execution
Job Consumer Service: Consumes from Kafka topics 'run', 'retry' with consumer group 'job-consumers', partitioned by job_id for ordering
Consumer receives: Job message {job_id, run_id, payload, attempt: 1}
Consumer creates: JobRun record in DB {run_id, job_id, status: 'pending', scheduled_at, created_at}
Consumer checks: Available executor capacity from Redis executors:available (tracks active jobs per executor), implements load balancing
Consumer dispatches: Job to Executor Service via internal API POST /executor/run with {run_id, job_id, payload}, updates status to 'running'
Executor updates: DB with status='running', start_time=NOW(), publishes heartbeat every 10s to Redis executor:{executor_id}:heartbeat
Step 4: Job Execution by Executor
Executor receives: Job details {run_id, job_id, payload}
Executor fetches: Full job definition from Job DB (or Redis cache with TTL=5 min) to get retry_count, timeout, dependencies
Executor runs: Job logic in isolated process/container (Docker container or separate thread with resource limits)
Job execution: Runs user-defined code (Python script, shell command, HTTP request to external service), streams logs to centralized logging (CloudWatch, ELK)
Timeout handling: If execution exceeds timeout (3600s), kill process, mark as 'timeout' status
Executor updates: DB with status='success' or 'failed', end_time, error_msg (if failed), execution_time_ms
Step 5: Retry Mechanism
On job failure: Executor checks job.retry_count > current_attempt (e.g., retry_count=3, attempt=1)
Executor publishes: To Kafka 'retry' topic with {job_id, run_id, payload, attempt: 2, retry_delay: 60s (exponential backoff)}
Delay calculation: retry_delay = base_delay * (2 ^ attempt) + jitter, e.g., 60s, 120s, 240s for attempts 1, 2, 3
Retry Consumer: Consumes from 'retry' topic, sleeps for retry_delay duration, then republishes to 'run' topic for re-execution
Final failure: If attempt > retry_count (e.g., attempt=4, retry_count=3), publish to 'dead' topic, update job status='failed_permanently', send alert
Step 6: DAG Dependency Resolution
Job definition: Job B depends on Job A completion - stored as jobs.dependencies = [job_a_id]
Scheduler checks: Before scheduling Job B, query JobRuns table WHERE job_id IN (dependencies) AND status='success' AND run_date = TODAY
Conditional execution: If all dependencies met, publish Job B to Kafka 'run', else skip and wait for next watcher cycle
Parallel execution: Jobs C and D both depend on B - once B succeeds, both C and D published simultaneously for parallel execution
Cycle detection: On job creation, run DFS (Depth-First Search) on dependency graph, reject job if cycle detected (e.g., A→B→C→A)
Step 7: Job Cancellation
User sends: POST /v1/api/jobs/{job_id}/cancel
Job Service checks: Current status - if 'scheduled' (not running), update status='cancelled' in DB, remove from next scheduling cycle
If status='running': Publish cancellation event to Kafka 'cancel' topic with {job_id, run_id}
Executor receives: Cancellation event via subscription to 'cancel' topic, sends SIGTERM to job process
Graceful shutdown: Process has 30s to cleanup (close DB connections, save state), then SIGKILL if not exited
Executor updates: DB with status='cancelled', end_time=NOW(), publishes completion event
Step 8: Monitoring & Health Checks
Watcher service monitors: Executor heartbeats in Redis, if executor:{id}:heartbeat not updated in 60s, mark executor as 'unhealthy'
Service identifies: Jobs running on unhealthy executor (query JobRuns WHERE executor_id={id} AND status='running')
Service reschedules: Those jobs by publishing to Kafka 'run' topic with note 'rescheduled_from_dead_executor', updates old run status='executor_died'
Dashboard metrics: Total jobs scheduled, running, success, failed (last 24h), avg execution time, success rate %, executors online/offline
Alerts: Triggered on: job failure rate >10%, executor capacity >80%, dead letter queue size >100 jobs
Step 9: Distributed Locking (Prevent Duplicate Execution)
Problem: Multiple watcher instances poll jobs, could schedule same job twice
Solution: Redis distributed lock using SETNX - before scheduling job, acquire lock: SET lock:job:{job_id}:schedule {watcher_id} NX EX 60
Lock acquired: Watcher schedules job (publishes to Kafka), releases lock DELETE lock:job:{job_id}:schedule
Lock failed: Another watcher already processing this job, skip to next job in query result
Auto-expiry: Lock expires in 60s if watcher crashes, prevents deadlock, next watcher cycle picks up job
Step 10: Handling Missed Jobs (Backfill)
Scenario: Scheduler down for 2 hours, 100 hourly jobs missed
Backfill detection: On watcher restart, query jobs WHERE next_run_time < (NOW - 2 * schedule_interval) AND status='scheduled'
Backfill strategy: For each missed job, create JobRun with scheduled_at = missed_time, status='backfill', publish to Kafka
Throttling: Publish backfill jobs at controlled rate (100 jobs/sec) to prevent overwhelming executors
User notification: Send alert 'Scheduler was down, running 100 missed jobs' for transparency
7. Client-Side Components (UI/CLI)

9. Alternative Scheduling Solutions

Approach 1: Event-Driven (Amazon EventBridge)
Concept: Jobs triggered by events instead of time-based polling
Implementation: EventBridge rules match cron expressions, trigger Lambda functions or SQS queues
Pros: Serverless, auto-scaling, no polling overhead, pay-per-execution
Cons: Vendor lock-in (AWS), limited to 300 targets per rule, cold start latency
Use case: Simple scheduled tasks, cloud-native architectures
Approach 2: Managed Service (AWS Step Functions, Temporal)
Concept: Workflow orchestration as a service with built-in retry, state management
Implementation: Define workflows as JSON (Step Functions) or code (Temporal), service handles execution
Pros: No infrastructure management, built-in monitoring, durable execution (survives crashes)
Cons: Cost (per state transition), learning curve, less control over execution
Use case: Complex workflows with multiple steps, enterprise applications
Approach 3: Custom with Delay Queue (RabbitMQ, SQS)
Concept: Use message queue's delay feature to schedule jobs
Implementation: Publish message with delay = (scheduled_time - now), consumer picks up when delay expires
Pros: Simple, leverages existing message queue, supports priorities
Cons: Limited to max delay (SQS: 15 min, need rescheduling), no cron support, poor for recurring jobs
Use case: One-time delayed jobs, reminder systems
10. Scaling & Optimization

Technique 1: Horizontal Executor Scaling - Add more executor instances, Kafka partitioning ensures parallel processing
Technique 2: Database Indexing - Index on (next_run_time, status, last_polled_time) for fast watcher queries
Technique 3: Job Caching - Cache job definitions in Redis (TTL: 5 min), reduces DB reads by 90%
Technique 4: Kafka Partitioning - Partition 'run' topic by job_id ensures ordering, prevents race conditions
Technique 5: Read Replicas - Route job history queries to PostgreSQL read replicas, writes to primary only
Technique 6: Watcher Sharding - Multiple watcher instances with different polling intervals (watcher-1: every 20s, watcher-2: every 60s for low-priority jobs)
Technique 7: Priority Queues - Separate Kafka topics for high/low priority jobs, high-priority consumers have more instances
Technique 8: Batch Processing - Watcher fetches 1000 jobs per query instead of 1, publishes in batch to Kafka
Technique 9: Circuit Breaker - If external job dependency (API) fails >5 times, pause job for 10 min, prevent spam
Technique 10: Execution Pooling - Executors maintain pool of worker threads/processes, reuse for multiple jobs (avoid cold start)
Technique 11: Log Aggregation - Stream job logs to S3/CloudWatch async, don't block job execution on log writes
Technique 12: Dead Letter Queue Monitoring - Alert when dead topic has >100 messages, indicates systemic issue
11. Common Interview Questions

Q
How do you prevent the same job from being scheduled twice by multiple watcher instances?
A
Distributed locking with Redis:

(1) Lock acquisition - before scheduling job, watcher attempts SET lock:job:{job_id}:schedule {watcher_id} NX EX 60 (set if not exists, 60s expiry),

(2) Lock success - if returns 1, watcher proceeds to publish job to Kafka, updates last_polled_time in DB, releases lock,

(3) Lock failure - if returns 0, another watcher already processing this job, skip to next job,

(4) Database-level protection - UPDATE jobs SET last_polled_time = NOW() WHERE job_id = {id} AND last_polled_time < (NOW - 30s), only updates if not recently polled,

(5) Auto-expiry - lock expires in 60s if watcher crashes, prevents deadlock. Alternative: Use Kafka as single-source scheduling - only 1 watcher publishes to Kafka (leader election via Zookeeper), consumers handle rest. Trade-off: Redis lock is faster, simpler vs Kafka leader election is more robust for multi-datacenter. Example: Job J1 next_run_time=10:00 AM → Watcher-1 and Watcher-2 poll at same time → Watcher-1 acquires lock → publishes J1 to Kafka → releases lock → Watcher-2's lock fails → skips J1.

Q
How do you handle jobs that are scheduled while the scheduler is down?
A
Backfill mechanism:

(1) Detection - on watcher restart, query jobs WHERE next_run_time < NOW() AND status IN ('scheduled', 'running'), identifies missed jobs,

(2) Categorization - jobs with next_run_time in last 2 hours = recent misses (high priority), >2 hours = stale (may skip or backfill based on policy),

(3) Backfill execution - for each missed job, create JobRun with scheduled_at = original_next_run_time, status='backfill', publish to Kafka 'run' topic,

(4) Rate limiting - publish backfill jobs at 100 jobs/sec to prevent overwhelming executors (if 1000 missed jobs, takes 10s to queue all),

(5) SLA check - if job has SLA (must run within 1 hour of schedule), skip if SLA breached, mark as 'missed_sla', alert user,

(6) Recurring jobs - for cron jobs, calculate all missed runs: if daily job down for 3 days, create 3 JobRuns for Day 1, 2, 3, or skip to most recent (configurable). Example: Scheduler down from 10:00-12:00, Job A scheduled hourly (10:00, 11:00, 12:00) → on restart at 12:05, detect 2 missed runs → backfill creates runs for 10:00, 11:00 → publish both to Kafka → executors process → update next_run_time to 13:00.

Q
How do you implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff?
A
Multi-stage retry pipeline:

(1) Initial failure - executor catches exception, checks job.retry_count (e.g., 3) vs current attempt

(1), if retries remaining, proceed,

(2) Delay calculation - retry_delay = base_delay * (2 ^ (attempt - 1)) + random(0, base_delay/2), example: attempt 1 → 60s, attempt 2 → 120s + jitter (0-30s), attempt 3 → 240s + jitter,

(3) Publish to retry topic - executor publishes to Kafka 'retry' with {job_id, run_id, payload, attempt: 2, scheduled_retry_at: NOW() + retry_delay},

(4) Retry consumer - dedicated consumer group reads 'retry' topic, for each message: calculate wait_time = scheduled_retry_at - NOW(), if wait_time > 0: sleep(wait_time), then republish to 'run' topic,

(5) Final failure - if attempt > retry_count, publish to 'dead' topic, update DB status='failed_permanently', send alert via SNS/email,

(6) Jitter rationale - prevents thundering herd (100 jobs fail at same time, all retry at exact same moment without jitter). Alternative: Use Kafka delayed message feature (Kafka 3.0+) or SQS delay queue for retry scheduling. Example: Job fails at 10:00 → retry_count=3 → attempt 1 fails → retry at 10:01 (60s) → attempt 2 fails → retry at 10:03 (120s) → attempt 3 fails → retry at 10:07 (240s) → attempt 4 (exceeds retry_count) → dead letter queue.

Q
How do you handle job dependencies in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)?
A
Dependency resolution with topological ordering:

(1) Storage - Job table has dependencies column: job_b.dependencies = [job_a_id, job_c_id] means B depends on A and C,

(2) Cycle detection - on job creation/update, run DFS (Depth-First Search) starting from new job, if visit same node twice, cycle exists, reject with 'Circular dependency detected: A→B→C→A',

(3) Scheduling check - watcher before scheduling Job B, queries: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_runs WHERE job_id IN (job_a_id, job_c_id) AND status='success' AND DATE(scheduled_at) = TODAY, if count != 2 (missing dependencies), skip Job B this cycle,

(4) Trigger on completion - when Job A completes successfully, publish 'job.completed' event to Kafka with {job_id: A, run_date},

(5) Dependency watcher - separate service consumes 'job.completed', queries jobs WHERE dependencies CONTAINS job_a_id, checks if all dependencies now met, if yes, publishes dependent jobs to 'run' topic,

(6) Parallel execution - jobs at same level (C and D both depend only on B) published simultaneously for parallel execution. Alternative: Airflow's approach - precompute DAG at deployment, store as graph in memory, traverse on each run. Example: DAG: A → B → C, D (B depends on A, C and D depend on B) → A runs at 10:00, succeeds → B scheduled for 10:05, succeeds → C and D both scheduled for 10:10 in parallel.

Q
What happens if an executor crashes while running a job?
A
Executor failure detection and recovery:

(1) Heartbeat monitoring - executors publish heartbeat to Redis executor:{id}:heartbeat every 10s with timestamp,

(2) Watcher health check - separate health check service polls Redis every 30s, checks if any executor's heartbeat > 60s old (3 missed heartbeats), marks as 'unhealthy',

(3) Job identification - query JobRuns WHERE executor_id = {unhealthy_id} AND status='running', finds orphaned jobs,

(4) Rescheduling - for each orphaned job: update status='executor_died', create new JobRun with attempt = old_attempt + 1 (counts as retry), publish to Kafka 'run' topic,

(5) Cleanup - remove executor:{id} from Redis executors:available pool, alert ops team,

(6) Idempotency requirement - jobs must be idempotent (safe to run multiple times) because crashed job may have partially completed before executor died. Example: Executor E1 running Job J1 (writing to database) → E1 crashes at 50% completion → heartbeat stops → health check detects after 60s → Job J1 rescheduled to Executor E2 → E2 re-runs full job → job's code must handle 'partial completion' scenario (check if data already written, skip or upsert). Prevention: Use distributed locks for critical sections (job locks specific resource before modifying).

Q
How do you implement priority-based job scheduling?
A
Multi-tier priority queue system:

(1) Priority definition - jobs have priority field (1-10, 10=highest), stored in Job table,

(2) Topic separation - Kafka topics: high_priority_run (priority 8-10), medium_priority_run (5-7), low_priority_run (1-4),

(3) Watcher routing - when scheduling job, publish to appropriate topic based on job.priority,

(4) Consumer allocation - high priority topic has 50 consumer instances, medium has 30, low has 20 (2.5x more resources for high priority),

(5) Within-topic ordering - jobs in same priority topic processed FIFO (First In First Out) using Kafka partitioning,

(6) Starvation prevention - if low priority jobs waiting >1 hour, temporarily boost to medium priority (aging algorithm). Alternative: Single topic with priority header, consumers poll high-priority partitions more frequently. Example: Job A (priority 9) and Job B (priority 3) scheduled at same time → A published to high_priority_run, B to low_priority_run → high topic has 50 consumers, low has 20 → A assigned to executor in <1s, B waits 5s for executor. Trade-off: More topics = more complexity but better isolation, single topic = simpler but consumers need priority-aware logic.

Q
How do you handle time zone conversions for scheduled jobs?
A
Server-side time zone normalization:

(1) Storage - all timestamps in DB stored as UTC (jobs.next_run_time = '2025-01-21T00:00:00Z'),

(2) User input - job creation accepts schedule with time zone: {schedule: '0 0 * * *', timezone: 'America/New_York'},

(3) Conversion on save - backend converts to UTC using timezone library (pytz in Python): cron '0 0 * * *' in EST (UTC-5) → UTC '0 5 * * *', stores UTC version,

(4) Display - when user views job, convert back to their timezone for display: '2025-01-21T00:00:00Z' UTC → '2025-01-20T19:00:00' EST,

(5) DST handling - recalculate next_run_time when daylight saving time changes (March/November), e.g., job '9 AM EST' shifts 1 hour in UTC,

(6) Watcher logic - always works in UTC, no timezone awareness needed for scheduling. Complexity: Recurring jobs across DST boundary - job scheduled for '2 AM EST daily' on DST start day (2 AM doesn't exist), skip to 3 AM or run at 1 AM (configurable). Example: User in India (IST, UTC+5:30) schedules job for daily at midnight local time → backend stores as UTC 18:30 previous day → watcher at 18:30 UTC triggers job → user sees '00:00 IST' in UI. Alternative: Store timezone with each job, watcher converts on-the-fly (more flexible but complex).

Q
How do you implement job cancellation for already running jobs?
A
Graceful cancellation protocol:

(1) User request - POST /jobs/{job_id}/cancel, service checks status, if 'running', publish to Kafka 'cancel' topic with {job_id, run_id},

(2) Executor subscription - all executors subscribe to 'cancel' topic with consumer group per executor (ensures all get message),

(3) Executor matching - executor checks if run_id matches currently running job, if yes, initiates cancellation,

(4) Signal sending - executor sends SIGTERM (signal 15) to job process, allows graceful shutdown (close connections, save state),

(5) Timeout - if process doesn't exit in 30s, send SIGKILL (signal 9) to force terminate,

(6) Status update - executor updates DB status='cancelled', end_time=NOW(), publishes 'job.cancelled' event,

(7) Cleanup - release any distributed locks held by job, rollback transactions if applicable. Edge case: Job already completed before cancellation received → executor ignores cancel message, DB status remains 'success'. Alternative: Use shared memory flag (Redis cancel:{run_id} = true), job periodically checks flag and exits if set (requires job code cooperation). Example: Long-running ETL job (2 hours) → user cancels after 30 min → cancel event published → executor sends SIGTERM → job's cleanup handler runs (commits partial data) → exits gracefully → status='cancelled', user can retry or analyze partial results.

Q
How do you prevent job duplication on executor restart?
A
Idempotent job execution with state tracking:

(1) Job uniqueness - each JobRun has unique run_id, executor stores currently_running_job = run_id in Redis on start,

(2) Restart detection - on executor restart, check Redis for currently_running_job, if exists, it was killed mid-execution,

(3) Status reconciliation - query DB for run_id status, if still 'running', mark as 'executor_died' (executor crashed), don't re-execute (prevents duplication),

(4) Kafka offset management - executor commits Kafka offset AFTER job completes, on restart, uncommitted messages re-delivered (at-least-once),

(5) Idempotency enforcement - job_id + scheduled_at combination ensures uniqueness, if executor tries to start job with same (job_id, scheduled_at), DB unique constraint fails, skip execution,

(6) Exactly-once attempt - use Kafka transactions (Kafka 0.11+) with transactional.id per executor, ensures message processed and offset committed atomically. Trade-off: At-least-once (simpler, requires idempotent jobs) vs exactly-once (complex, guarantees no duplication but slower). Example: Executor E1 running Job J1 (run_id=R1) → E1 crashes → E1 restarts → checks Redis, finds currently_running_job=R1 → queries DB, R1 status='running' → updates R1 to 'executor_died', doesn't re-run → health check reschedules R1 with new run_id=R2 → counted as retry.

Q
What's your strategy for monitoring and alerting on job failures?
A
Multi-level monitoring and alerting:

(1) Metrics collection - executors publish metrics to Prometheus/CloudWatch: job_success_count, job_failure_count, job_duration_ms, jobs_in_queue (by priority),

(2) Failure thresholds - alert rules: single job failure rate >50% (6 of last 10 runs failed) = critical alert, overall system failure rate >10% in 1 hour = warning,

(3) SLA monitoring - if job has SLA (must complete within 2 hours of schedule), alert if end_time - scheduled_at > 2 hours,

(4) Dead letter queue size - alert if dead topic has >100 messages (indicates systemic issue, not isolated failures),

(5) Executor health - alert if <30% executors healthy (capacity issue),

(6) Dashboard - Grafana dashboard showing: jobs by status (pie chart), execution time trends (line graph), failure reasons (top 10 errors). Alert channels:

(7) PagerDuty for critical (job X failed 5 times),

(8) Slack for warnings (10% system failure rate),

(9) Email daily digest of all failures. Example: ETL job fails 3 times in row → alert 'Job ETL_Pipeline failing (3/3 attempts), error: DB connection timeout' sent to Slack → on-call engineer investigates, finds DB overloaded → scales DB → job succeeds on retry 4.

Job Timeout — Default 3600s (1 hour), configurable per job
Cancellation Timeout — 30s for SIGTERM, then SIGKILL
Database & Caching
Watcher Query Limit — 1000 jobs per query (batch processing)
Job Cache TTL — 5 minutes in Redis for job definitions
Index Fields — next_run_time, status, last_polled_time for fast queries
Kafka Retention — 7 days for replay capability
Priority Scheduling
Priority Levels — 1-10 scale (10=highest, 1=lowest)
Consumer Allocation — High: 50 instances, Medium: 30, Low: 20
Starvation Prevention — Boost priority if waiting >1 hour
Monitoring Thresholds
Failure Rate Alert — Single job >50% failure rate (6/10 runs)
System Failure Alert — Overall >10% failure rate in 1 hour
Dead Queue Alert — >100 messages in dead letter queue
Executor Capacity Alert — <30% healthy executors remaining
Example Calculation - Job Scheduling
Watcher Poll — 20s interval, fetches 1000 jobs
Lock Acquisition — 10ms per job (Redis SETNX)
Kafka Publish — 50ms for batch of 1000 jobs
Consumer Processing — 100ms from Kafka to executor assignment
Total Latency — 20s (polling) + 0.16s (processing) = ~20s from schedule time
Resource Allocation
Executor Pool Size — 100 executors × 10 threads/executor = 1000 concurrent jobs
Memory per Job — 512MB default, configurable up to 4GB
CPU per Job — 0.5 vCPU default, configurable up to 4 vCPU
Backfill Rate — 100 jobs/sec to prevent overload
Key Interview Tips

⚠️
NEVER assume jobs are idempotent. Always design for at-least-once execution. Executors may crash mid-job, jobs may be rescheduled, retries happen. Jobs MUST handle duplicate execution safely (check state, upsert not insert).

⭐
Interviewers ALWAYS ask: 'How to prevent duplicate scheduling?'. Answer: (1) Redis distributed lock (SETNX) before publishing to Kafka, (2) Database last_polled_time update with WHERE clause, (3) Kafka exactly-once semantics with transactional.id. Show understanding of multiple layers.

💡
Key optimization: Batch watcher queries. Fetching 1 job per query = 1000 queries/min overhead. Fetching 1000 jobs per query = 1 query/min, 1000x reduction in DB load. Pagination + batch Kafka publishing critical for scale.

⭐
Must mention: Exponential backoff with jitter. Without jitter, 100 jobs failing at same time all retry at exact same moment → thundering herd → system overload. Jitter (random 0-30s) spreads retries over time.

⚠️
NEVER use polling interval <10 seconds for watcher. 5s interval = 12 polls/min = 12 DB queries/min + 12 lock acquisitions. Minimal latency improvement but 2x overhead. 20s interval is sweet spot for most use cases.

💡
DAG cycle detection is critical. Allow A→B→C→A dependency creates infinite loop, system hangs. Run DFS on dependency graph during job creation, reject if cycle found. Also limit dependency depth (e.g., max 10 levels).

⭐
Interviewers love asking: 'What if executor crashes during job execution?'. Answer: (1) Heartbeat monitoring detects dead executor, (2) Orphaned jobs rescheduled as retries, (3) Jobs must be idempotent. Show understanding of failure recovery.

⚠️
NEVER store job logs in database. 100K jobs/day × 10KB logs = 1GB/day, 365GB/year in DB (expensive, slow queries). Stream logs to S3/CloudWatch, store only URL in DB. DB for metadata, object storage for logs.

💡
Priority queue via separate Kafka topics is simpler than single-topic priority. 3 topics (high/med/low) with different consumer counts gives natural prioritization. Single topic requires custom consumer logic to peek at priority header.

⭐
Must explain: At-least-once vs exactly-once execution. At-least-once is simpler (Kafka default), requires idempotent jobs. Exactly-once needs Kafka transactions (complex, performance hit). For job scheduling, at-least-once + idempotency is standard.
