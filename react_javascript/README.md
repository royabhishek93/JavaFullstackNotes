## Quick Q&A Files (3-5 minutes per question)

| Q# | Question | Study Time |
|----|----------|-----------|
| [Q1](Q1_typescript_jsx_compilation.md) | TypeScript JSX compilation process? | 4m |
| [Q2](Q2_tsx_compilation_pipeline.md) | TSX compilation pipeline (TypeScript + React)? | 5m |

## Topics Covered

- TypeScript compilation to JavaScript
- JSX transformation
- TSX (TypeScript + JSX) compilation
- Build toolchain (tsc, Babel, webpack)
- Type checking vs transpilation

## Why This Section Exists

Full-stack Java developers often need to understand frontend build processes when:
- Working on Spring Boot + React applications
- Debugging frontend build issues
- Optimizing frontend bundling
- Understanding type safety across stack
